# UFOs

## Overview - Purpose of this project
United Fruitcake Outlet (UFO for short) is an organization that, while presenting as a storefront selling winter seasonal confections, actually exists as a front for enthusiasts studying UFO sightnings, among other clues (rradio telescopes, Nostradamus writings), in an attempt to make contact with extraterrestrial beings.

They have compliled a list of UFO sightings, with characteristics specified including 
- date of the observation
- city
- state
- country 
- shape/ form of the UFO, and comments of the observation.

Dana has engaged us to package this list in a website, allowing the user to filter by any combination of the primary characteristics; for example, I, as a resident of Massachusetts, can look for sightnings near to home, and be on the alert for similar manifistations in the future.

## User's Guide to the Website
When this site is loaded, a full list of sightings is available at the bottom as you scroll down the screen. This makes for compelling reading, but is a bit overwhelming.

[File as first loaded](/Resources/full_list.png)

As you scroll down, to the left of the listings (or above if viewing on a narrow screen) you will see a number of input boxes that can be used to filter the results by date, city, state, country, or shape. These have sample data filled in, but only as guidance - this sample data does NOT filter the data.

As an example of filtering, you can put a state code in the State field.

To filter by an additional field, enter the new filter in the appropriate box

Finally, to reset / remove all filters, click on the "UFO Sightings" banner on the top of the page.



## Limitations / suggestions for next steps
### cosmetic and compatability details
- built for Chrome. Seems to work on Microsoft Edge as well, has not been tested on other browsers
- Filter rows are not well lined up

### design shortcomings
- dates: would be good to allow for a selections of date ranges, not limited to one date. For example, are encounters more common in the springs? It would take patience to count throught one date at a time.
- states/cities: would be nice to include regions, or an extra parameter - within *x* miles - to catch nearby sightings
- states/cities: maybe make available as radion buttons, so user can select more than one at a time. Would need to update the filtering logic as well, but we've got the tools for this.
- all fields: sample text shows in same font / color as actual filled-in filter field. Should stand out to reflect that these values are actually being used

We have enjoyed the opportunity to work on this project, remain available for questions, and would be glad to continue our involvment to follow through on the design issues listed above, or any other enhancements you might like to see.
